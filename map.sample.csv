# File that holds information of the data is should be written to the SD card
# represented by the data in the output directory
#
# Each line (not starting with a #) in this file represents a music file or a
# directory containing multiple media files.
# Each line has 2 columns separated by a colon (";"):
#   1. Target
#   2. Source
#
# A target and a source can either refer to an individual file or to a
# directory containing multiple files.
# If the target is a file, the source must also be a file.
# If the target is a directory, the source must also be a directory.
# The file names in target directory will be automatically created
# depending on the number of files in the source directory.
#
# Target
# ------
# The target refers to a location in the file system relative to the output
# directory of the SD card script. If the output directory is "out" the first
# target folder "01" will expand to "out/01".
#
# Targets can have up to 2 elements separated by a slash ("/").
# 1. The first element is a numeric name with a length of 2 characters
#    01 .. 99 representing a folder name.
# 2. The (optional) second element is a numeric name with a length of 3 chars
#    001 .. 999. It presents a name in the folder (the first element) of an
#    MP3 audio file.
#
# Note: Only numeric names are allowed!
#
# Source
# ------
# The source refers to a location in the file system. It can either be an
# absolute path (starting with a slash "/") or a path relative to the current
# directory. The source name can also have spaces.
